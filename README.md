What It Is
===========

> "An example would be handy right about now." - Brian Marick

There are numerous ways to approach software design and development, each with various pros and cons (e.g. TDD, DCI, POODR). But one thing we have yet to see is a consistent example used to demonstrate each of them.

Does such an example exist? One robust enough to serve as a flexible teaching tool? We don't know, but we at Arlington Ruby aim to find out.



Guidelines
===========

1. Choose an approach you'd like to take (e.g. TDD, Outside In, DCI, POODR, etc.)
2. Fork the repo
3. Create a new directory and name it by approach and github handle (e.g. TDD_elight)
4. Build your rendition of Conway's Game Of Life
5. Perform micro-commits along the way with helpful commit messages to illustrate the evolution of your app
6. When you're done, submit a pull request
